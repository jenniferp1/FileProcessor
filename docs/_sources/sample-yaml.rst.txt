An example of the YAML format required to process files using `FileProcessor.process() <./fileprocr.html#fileprocr.FileProcessor.FileProcessor.process>`_.

A fully qualified path + yaml file name should be passed as one of the arguments to `FileProcessor.process()`.

Data blocks in the YAML should have a header name that is the same as the file name of the file being processed.
For example, if you are processing a file called `MyExcel.xlsx` then the header in the YAML should be `MyExcel.xlsx`
(as shown in figure above).

The values assgined to the `class` and `method` keys should identify the mixin class and method name of the processor
that is used to process the data from `MyExcel.xlsx`.

**Usage example**

.. code-block:: python

  # identify directory your files are located
  path = "C:/Documents/projects/ReportingPlatform/FilesForUpload"

  # identify where your YAML is located
  proc_yaml = "C:/Documents/projects/ReportingPlatform/processors/processors.yml"

  # initialize instance of FileProcessor
  processor = FileProcessor(path)

  # get list of files in directory
  fnames = processor.files()
  print(fnames)

**OUTPUT**

{"C:/Documents/projects/ReportingPlatform/FilesForUpload/MyExcel.xlsx":["xlsx"],
| "C:/Documents/projects/ReportingPlatform/FilesForUpload/MyHTML.eml":["eml"]}

Assuming you want to process data from MyExcel.xlsx:

.. code-block :: python

  file = "C:/Documents/projects/ReportingPlatform/FilesForUpload/MyExcel.xlsx"
  ext = "xlsx"

  # load data from file to DataFrame
  df = processor.load(file, ext)

  # process data for upload to data warehouse
  df = processor.process(file, df, proc_yaml)
